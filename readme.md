I created wireframes using Figma of both the mobile and laptop/desktop experience https://www.figma.com/design/Lpl68HzQd44V0edQvhslBI/Task-App---Mobile?node-id=0-1&t=vZK3qjPayKDaZytH-1 ( mobile & desktop)

In this project is a Task Mgmt System that contains a home page,registration page, login page, dashboard page, task details and task creation page. I utilized Bootstrap forms and components to craft a pleasant and intuitive UI.
